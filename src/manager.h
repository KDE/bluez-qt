/**
 * @class BluezQt::Manager manager.h <BluezQt/Manager>
 *
 * Bluetooth manager.
 *
 * The entry point to communicate with system BlueZ daemon.
 *
 * The typical usecase is to work with usableAdapter() (any powered adapter),
 * but it is also possible to use specific adapter.
 *
 * You must call init() before other functions can be used.
 *
 * The only functions that can be used before initialization are two rfkill-related
 * functions: isBluetoothBlocked() and setBluetoothBlocked().
 *
 * Example use in C++ code:
 * @code
 * BluezQt::Manager *manager = new BluezQt::Manager();
 * BluezQt::InitManagerJob *job = manager->init();
 * job->start();
 * connect(job, &BluezQt::InitManagerJob::result, ...);
 * @endcode
 *
 * In QML, manager is a singleton and initialization is started when first using
 * the manager. You don't need to track initialized state, just use property binding.
 *
 * Example use in QML code:
 * @code
 * import QtQuick 2.2
 * import org.kde.bluezqt 1.0 as BluezQt
 *
 * Item {
 *     property QtObject manager : BluezQt.Manager
 *     property devicesCount : manager.devices.length
 *     property adaptersCount : manager.adapters.length
 *
 *     Component.onCompleted: {
 *         console.log("Manager operational:", manager.operational)
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note All communication with BlueZ daemon happens asynchronously. Almost all methods
 *       returns PendingCall to help track the call progress and to check for any errors.
 *
 * @note If manager is not operational, all methods that returns a PendingCall will fail
 *       with PendingCall::InternalError.
 *
 * @see InitManagerJob
