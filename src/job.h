/**
 * @class BluezQt::Job job.h <BluezQt/Job>
 *
 * This class represents an asynchronous job performed by BluezQt,
 * it is usually not used directly but instead it is inherit by some
 * other class.
 *
 * There are two ways of using this class, one is via exec() which will block
 * the thread until a result is fetched, the other is via connecting to the
 * signal result()
 *
 * Please, think twice before using exec(), it should be used only in either
 * unittest or cli apps.
 *
 * @note Job and its subclasses are meant to be used in a fire-and-forget way.
 * Jobs will delete themselves when they finish using deleteLater().
 *
 * @note Even given their asynchronous nature, Jobs are still executed in the
 * main thread, so any blocking code executed in it will block the app calling it.
 *
 * @see InitManagerJob
 * @see InitObexManagerJob
